- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Denny
- ðŸ‘€ I have a broad list of skills and competencies, but I taught myself to program computers in high school, and that skill is still close to my heart. I see programming as an art for left-brain thinkers. A clearly written and bug-free program is an expression of the author's skill and expertise as much as an oil painting. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Javascript through HackReactor Boot Camp
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: message on GitHub or LinkedIn
